<font color="green"><H1>Strategy</h1></font>

### The Strategy and Performance Management team is tasked with setting overall Group strategy, including the allocation of capital, to deliver sustainable earnings growth. We look to our Operating Companies to create ambitious, long-term growth strategies for DMGT to invest behind.

<font color="green"><H2>Key operating principles</h2></font>

* Growth strategies and associated financial plans, once agreed and approved by DMGT, provide the framework within which we expect Operating Companies to be run and inform how DMGT allocates capital.
* Due to the impact each Operating Company’s own strategic plan has on DMGT’s fiscal budgeting process, growth strategies and budgets are to be prepared realistically,with a strong expectation of delivery.
* DMGT closely tracks actual performance versus approved strategies and financial plans on a monthly basis via Performance Management Dashboards.
* DMGT manages the Group in accordance with three portfolio roles – Operating at scale, Focused growth and Early bets – each with distinct performance objectives and contribution expectations. A robust articulation of DMGT’s portfolio roles is provided in
