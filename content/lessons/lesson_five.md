### As a public company DMGT is required to have a formal Board and governance procedures in place to protect that status. The Board delegates certain responsibilities to its Committees which meet regularly. In addition to these formal meetings, an operating rhythm of regular interactions between DMGT and Operating Company management has been established to streamline the approval process and ensure that business critical deadlines are met.
