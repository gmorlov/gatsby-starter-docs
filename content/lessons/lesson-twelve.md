### Early communication of all merger, acquisition, investment and disposal activities is required to DMGT via DMGT Group Head Corporate Development and M&A (DMGT Group Head CDMA).

#### Prior to communicating any interest in acquisitions or investments, DMGT Group Head CDMA should be consulted. Approval from DMGT (see Approvals table) is required to discuss indications of interest or issue a Letter of Intent “LoI” for a proposed investment or acquisition.

<font color="green"><H2>Key operating principles</h2></font>

* DMGT Group Head CDMA must be consulted on any M&A.
* Be responsible in considering the implications for DMGT of disclosing information regarding any planned or potential M&A, both verbally and written, and publicly.
* All strategy and business development activities are only undertaken with trusted parties and advisors. If you are uncertain as to the trustworthiness of these, please discuss with DMGT Group Head CDMA.
* All negotiations of acquisition/investment terms should be discussed in advance with DMGT Group Head CDMA. 
* Proper due diligence must be completed prior to the conclusion of any acquisition or investment and planned in coordination with DMGT.
* Integration/implementation planning and detailed planning relating to technology mitigation/migration should be an integral part of all acquisitions. Regular reports back to the Investment & Finance Committee should be provided to give updates on progress relative to these plans.
* Regular review of all M&A/investments will be carried out by the Investment & Finance Committee.


<font color="green"><H2>Actions required</h2></font>

* All Indications of Interest (non-binding, permission to discuss deal terms) to be discussed with DMGT Group Head CDMA.
* Supporting materials for approval of an LoI can include a Word document and/or PowerPoint. Additionally, the DMGT Group Head CDMA can provide examples and provide guidance on most appropriate format.
* All LoIs issued are assumed to be non-binding in nature – approval to issue a LoI is not to be considered as approval of a final transaction.
* After approval to issue a LoI has been granted, Operating Company management should continue to consult with DMGT, particularly the DMGT Group Head CDMA.
* Prior to concluding any transaction, appropriate approvals should be sought, supported by a more detailed paper (See: 
<font color="PURPLE"><H2>INSERT LINK TO PAGE 18 TABLE</h2></font>)
* A detailed integration/implementation plan should be developed as part of all approvals sought from DMGT.
* The DMGT CTO should be consulted early in the due diligence process and provide input into technology/product due diligence, including integration planning. This should include future technology investments needed/anticipated and should include all projections.
