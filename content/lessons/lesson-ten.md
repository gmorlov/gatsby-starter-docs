### The Strategy and Performance Management team is tasked with setting overall Group strategy, including the allocation of capital, to deliver sustainable earnings growth. We look to our Operating Companies to create ambitious, long-term growth strategies for DMGT to invest behind.

<font color="green"><H2>Key operating principles</h2></font>

* Growth strategies and associated financial plans, once agreed and approved by DMGT, provide the framework within which we expect Operating Companies to be run and inform how DMGT allocates capital.
* Due to the impact each Operating Company’s own strategic plan has on DMGT’s fiscal budgeting process, growth strategies and budgets are to be prepared realistically,with a strong expectation of delivery.
* DMGT closely tracks actual performance versus approved strategies and financial plans on a monthly basis via Performance Management Dashboards.
* DMGT manages the Group in accordance with three portfolio roles – Operating at scale, Focused growth and Early bets – each with distinct performance objectives and contribution expectations. A robust articulation of DMGT’s portfolio roles is provided in

* The Strategy & Performance Management team is committed to supporting DMGT’s Operating Companies as they deliver performance outcomes in accordance with their particular portfolio role. This support is provided through DMGT’s Performance Improvement Programme (PIP).
* DMGT’s long-term vision is ‘Intelligent Insights. Consumer Connections’, the intersection of our Consumer experience and our B2B opportunities. See

and [DMGT's 2018 Investor Briefing]

* Over the long-term, the Strategy & Performance Management team will help DMGT take advantage of the opportunities presented by ‘Intelligent Insights. Consumer Connections’ through selective organic and inorganic investments, often in collaboration with DMGT’s Operating Companies and management.

<font color="green"><H2>Action required</h2></font>

* The PIP includes Playbooks of best practices and execution templates across five value creation levers: Product, Commercial, Technology, Operations and People. Strategy & Performance Management team members partner with DMGT’s Operating Companies to select and execute PIP initiatives that help to addressthe needs and ambitions of each company. For assistance developing and executing PIP initiatives or for access to the latest library of DMGT PIP Playbooks, contact the Director, Strategy & Performance Management.
* Operating Company leadership are expected to keep the Strategy & Performance Management team informed of current strategic thinking and priorities, as well as any changes or challenges that may arise, through regular dialogue and updates. Monthly Performance Management Dashboards provide one regular touchpoint between Operating Company leadership and the Strategy & Performance Management team; questions arising from the Strategy & Performance Management team regarding the monthly dashboards are expected to be addressed in a timely and factual manner.

<font color="green"><H2>Interactions with DMGT</h2></font>

* Approval to execute against a given strategic plan will be provided by DMGT’s Executive Committee, Investment & Finance Committee and/or Board of Directors, in accordance with the quantum of investment required and degree of strategic pivot implied. Refer to the <font color="purple"><H2>INSERT LINK TO PAGE 16 HERE</h2></font> for further information.


* Approvals should be sought via the Approvals meeting.
* Should Operating Company leadership not wish to involve the Strategy & Performance Management team in PIP initiative or a strategic review, DMGT requires that the Director, Strategy & Performance Management be kept abreast of all work and be invited to provide input throughout.
* Performance Management Dashboard KPIs should be set by Operating Company CEOs and CFOs and the Strategy & Performance Management team, with monthly discussions to update on strategic progress and any changes in trajectory.
