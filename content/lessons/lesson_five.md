### As a public company DMGT is required to have a formal Board and governance procedures in place to protect that status. The Board delegates certain responsibilities to its Committees which meet regularly. In addition to these formal meetings, an operating rhythm of regular interactions between DMGT and Operating Company management has been established to streamline the approval process and ensure that business critical deadlines are met.

#### DMGT Board and Committees:

* Papers reviewed two weeks prior to the meeting.

* Papers distributed to Committee members one week prior to the meeting.

Items for which papers are not delivered within these timeframes may be taken off the relevant agenda.
